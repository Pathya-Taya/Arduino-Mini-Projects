Welcome! In this project I created a standalone temperature and humidity display, with 3 modes: Temperature in Celsius, Percentage Humidity and Temperature in Farenhiet.  <br>
Also I've attached a code I created containing a convinient function for using 4-digit 7-segment displays.  <br>

Components used:  <br>
DHT-11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity.  <br>
4-digit 7-Segment Display: Shows the temperature and humidity values.  <br>
Potentiometer: For choosing which mode to use(Celsius/Farenhiet/Humidity).  <br>
Arduino, Breadboard and Wires.
