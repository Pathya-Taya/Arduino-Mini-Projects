**Google Dino Game Player**

This project demonstrates how I used an Arduino to play the infamous Google Dino game that appears when you lose internet connection.
Using an arduino can be much faster than our reflexes and measuring the change in light dependent resistance attached such that when a cactus approaches, we can make the dino jump using a servo motor.

Components Used:
Arduino Uno
Servo: For jumping
Light Dependent Resistance (LDR): For sensing obstacles
A device to play the game on
BreadBoard and connecting wires.
